    "The intended outcome for this machine learning process is to see whether predictions for expected points are accurate predictors of player's performances and fantasy league returns. \n",

    "- The features will be all variables constructed that do not include the current gameweeks stats\n",

    "The models that will be considered are as follows:\n",
    "- Baseline Model\n",

    "- Linear Regression\n",
    "> Based on EDA so far it would suggest there is a linear relationship with a portion of the variables and is a good place to start for a simple model. High interpretability of results will be useful to demonstrate how useful the new form variables are.\n",
    "- Ridge Regression\n",
    "> Regularization to review whether improves performance. The high dimensionality of the data would suggest this could be beneficial.\n",
    "> The model will be tuned via grid search cross validation.\n",
    "- Decision Tree\n",
    "> A number of variables within the model have a large impact on which variables are more important such as a players position or the quality of the team played for. A decision tree regression may capture this better and also offers clear interpretation. This model may also estimate non-linear variables clearer.\n",
